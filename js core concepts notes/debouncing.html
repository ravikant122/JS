    <!-- as soone as the user input a letter number, it will calculate sum if we use calculateSum, which is our base function 
   to fetch some, means we'll call the API on every letter user enters

   that's why we've to wait for user to enter the number he/she wants to enter
   this principal of delaying the call to an API is called debouncing
   and we can achieve this using setTimeout

   on first input, we start setTimeout for some delay like 1sec(or 100ms) as if user again inputs then we cancel
   current timeout and start a new one
